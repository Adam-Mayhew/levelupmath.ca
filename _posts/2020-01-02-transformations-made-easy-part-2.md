In [part 1](math 30-1/2020/01/01/transformations-made-easy-part-1.html) we learned how to properly identify transformations. Now we're going to learn how to apply them to graphs.

![Example 1](\assets\images\Mapping Notation Photos\Mapping-notation-1.jpg)

In the picture above you can see a graph and some transformations on f(x) that we are going to apply. First we identify each transformation using the skills we learned in part 1.

![Example 1](\assets\images\Mapping Notation Photos\Mapping-notation-2.jpg)

<br/>

Next we write down the math that each transformation creates to each variable. This is called mapping notation. We apply the horizontal transformations to X and the verticals to Y, keeping numbers that were originally multiplication as multiplication and the numbers that were addition/subtraction as addition/subtraction.

> Note that there is almost no difference between a stretch and a reflection in the mapping notation. You just include the negative with your multiplication.

<br/>

Now that we know the operations we are going to apply to each point we simply plug in each coordinate of our original points and find our new points.

<br/>

Finally we plot our new points on our graph like so.

And kabam! We're all done, mission accomplished! You are now a transformations wizard! While there is more to transformations than just what I've shown here, this is a very large part of it. It is also the most important part because it applies throughout the rest of Math 30-1, especially to logarithms and trigonometry. I hope these short lessons on transformations have helped you. If you still need help drop me a [line](/index.html#contact) and book a one-on-one tutoring session and I'll get you sorted out.
