Covid-19 may prevent us going to school but it can't stop us learning! All of my students have converted to online tutoring without a hitch so if you're finding that your schools online video lessons or notes aren't enough for you then I'm your guy! When I tutor online I use a webcam to show you what I'm doing on my whiteboard while you can send me photos of the homework and textbook questions you need help with. I also have copies of most textbooks on my computer so we can work through all the units together. We can use Skype, Zoom, Discord, or even Facebook for tutoring. Stay safe and stay smart!
